NOTES ON CONSTRUCTION:
1. Language name attribute values are case-sensitive and must be unique.
2. Language abbreviated-name attribute values are case-sensitive, must be unique, and
   must be composed of characters from this set 
   "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789".
3. Language parent attribute values are case-sensitive and must refer to the parent's 
   language name.
4. Circular parental references are BAD! (example: langA has parent langB, langB has parent 
   langC, and langC has parent langA).
5. Each language, with its parents included, must have at least one scanning-codepoint.
6. Where possible, language abbreviated names come from: 
   http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/opentype/languagetags.aspx.

USEFUL SOURCES:
1. For Latin and Cyrillic based languages, the eki.ee letter databases are fabulous!
   http://www.eki.ee/letter/
2. Unicode consortium code charts. Note especially that besides letters or ideographs 
   needed to write a language, currency
   symbols (http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U20A0.pdf) and punctuation
   (http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2000.pdf) have
   their own blocks, and many languages use some common characters from ASCII
   (http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf).
3. Speaking of punctuation, how do you know which quote marks a language needs? 
   This Wikipedia page is good.

Release Notes:

v1.20  2014-02-05  Revised Thai block definitions so real fonts can pass.

v1.21  2014-02-18  Thanks to Michel Boyer for corrections and feedback.
Revised French definitions to make important accented characters required.
Corrected erroneous "parent-name" attribute (should have been "parent") for 
Tajik, TalyshCyrillic, TurkmenCyrillic, Tuvan, Udmurt.
Added "parent=Arabic" for Farsi, Pashto, Sindhi, Uighur and Kazakh (Arabic).
Ukrainian now has "parent=Russian" instead of "parent=Cyrillic" (smaller character set)

v1.22  2014-02-21  Added many characters to erroneous Slovak definition.
deleted erroneous 0x0115 (lower case e with breve) from Adobe Latin 3 definition

v1.23  2014-03-31  Removed unnecessary scanning-codepoints block in Serbo-CroatianCyrillic definition.

v1.24  2014-04-21  Removed empty blocks as Extensis infrastructure no longer requires 
them. Updated definitions of Adobe Latin 1 to 5 and Adobe Cyrillic 1 to 3 character sets 
to match latest Adobe usage, as seen in the FontLab .enc files made here: 
https://github.com/tphinney/font-tools
Also added new currency symbols to various subsetting definitions, especially
various Cyrillic and Indian writing systems. (Tenge, turgrik, ruble, hryvni, rupee....)
